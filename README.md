# Bird-Strike

Bird Strike is a fun and humorous task management 2D game set in a plane's cockpit where the player needs to do all the required tasks in a limited amount of time in order to not crash the plane/ lose their pilot license. The player has to switch between 3 angles of the cockpit, making sure to manage all their tasks efficiently. If the player is too distracted by a task and not looking outside, there might be a bird strike! Ignoring other tasks also deducts points and may leads to the player losing their pilot license. The goal is to survive the game as long as possible.

## Motivation
This project was made for Concordia's ConUHacks hackaton. We were prompted to make a cockpit simulator that does something other than flying. After some brainstroming we landed on the idea of "Bird Strike" a fun and humorous task management game. 

## Build Status
We were able to complete the game during the hackaton. However, since we completed the game in less then two days, there is still possibility to come back to it and do some polishing as well as minor bug fixes.

## Features
- How to play screen
- 3 views of the cockpit
- Ambient sound and sound effects
3 task to manage:
- While in front view, the player must hit the birds before they come too close to the plane.
- In case of turbulence (animation), the player must stwich to left view and alert the passenger through an intercome.
- In case of an incoming message alert, the player must switch to left view and accept the message. The message then indicates which button the payer must press on the control panel of the cockpit. The player then must switch to front view to press the button.

## Code style and Engine
The game was made using C# and Unity.
